Repo of a starter GameMaker Studio 2 project. Following in the style of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ny19lk52RU by Badwrong.
Starting to understand the style of faux-inheritence as composition.
This project is not itself a game but rather a project to explore character movement and iterate on mechanics.
